    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

(You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true. It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

It has too much brightness and I am using max brightness at 40% only.Battery backup: I am happy with battery backup.I received battery backup up to 8 hrs while used Powerpoint and Word.Up to 4.5 Hrs, two 1080p movies on 40% brightness.I will totally recommend this laptop.

    Although the specifications are rich, performance is poor. Hanging issues are as usual. Performance wise disappointed.

    My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

    Hi there,Writing this review after 2+ months of use.Before buy I saw some negative review so little hesitated before buy. But as soon as turn it on and surprised with the speed. Let's go for little details.It has a powerful CPU, same CPU used in laptop above 70K laptop.Full HD screen with antiglare.Nice finishing and look.*256GB SSD*Most important is SPEED.I saw some people given a negative review about speed, I don't know what are they using. I am a developer and using Android studio, Visual studio and sometimes using VIrtual machine (VMware).I used common sense before buying this laptop. If you see the laptop buying guide, then you will find this is well suitable.The little issue here is. It has 4GB RAM only but thanks to SSD to take care of it. But If you are using much software at the same time so consider for upgrading at least 4GB RAM.I never played Game on this laptop so I can't give a comment but for gaming, you must consider for dedicated powerful Graphics card so in the laptop, above 70K.Somebody has given a review that it has less brightness, not true.
