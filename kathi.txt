All the supporting cast fit their roles to perfection.
The best aspect of the movie is the bgm from sam c.s . Brilliant guy but not recognised as much.
The cinematography of the movie was one to talk about. Provided the lighting of the movie should be dark ,they have done a fantastic job at that.
Overall a very enjoyable movie"

"184" "Karthi feels very raw and rugged in this movie.i feel nowadays the entire story doesn't have to be good, but some really good scenes make you feel the movie is good. kaithi has some ridiculously enjoyable scenes and a good story too.there might be some logical flaws, but who cares if the stunts are that good.
All the supporting cast fit their roles to perfection.
The best aspect of the movie is the bgm from sam c.s . Brilliant guy but not recognised as much.
The cinematography of the movie was one to talk about. Provided the lighting of the movie should be dark ,they have done a fantastic job at that.
Overall a very enjoyable movie"
